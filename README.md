This project is a junior frontend mentor challenge that I decided to recreate using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to replicate how it looked as closely as possible, and also provide all of the functionality frontend mentor asked me to achieve. If you don't know how frontend mentor works, they give you images of a design, showing active state, and mobile/desktop sizing, and you have to recreate it as best as possible.
